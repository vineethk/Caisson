You need to have a Scala compiler to be able to compile the source. This is how you would get the compiler running:
1. Compile the source code: 
$ scalac src/*.scala
2. Run the compiler:
$ scala CaissonCompiler <filename>

A test caisson file has been included for you to check the working of the compiler.

A code generator and a validator is yet to be added.
